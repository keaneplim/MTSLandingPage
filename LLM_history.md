# LLM Interaction History: Mitra Trans Perkasa

## Session Date: February 14, 2026

### 1. Project Initialization
- **Request:** Create a high-quality landing page for "Mitra Trans Perkasa".
- **Action:** Scaffolded Next.js 16 app with Tailwind v4 and TypeScript. Defined the "White and Blue" corporate theme.

### 2. Identity & Branding
- **Design:** Created a custom SVG logo (Hexagonal Shield) to replace the simple text placeholder.
- **Refinement:** Updated brand name to "MITRA TRANS PERKASA" on a single line with consistent bold typography across the site.

### 3. Content Refinement
- **Services:** Removed "Warehouse No. C-3" specific card and "Learn More" links per user request to streamline the focus on core capabilities.
- **Visuals:** Debugged broken Unsplash links for "Logistics Research" and ensured "Inland Transportation" featured a truck instead of a warehouse.

### 4. Responsiveness & UI Fixes
- **Audit:** Conducted a system-wide responsiveness check.
- **Navbar Bug:** Fixed a visibility issue where the brand name turned dark on dark backgrounds at tablet sizes.
- **Breakpoint Adjustment:** Moved mobile menu switch to `lg` (1024px) to accommodate the long brand name on medium screens.
- **Fluid Typography:** Implemented scaling font sizes across all sections to ensure readability on all devices.

### 6. Final Polish & Simplification
- **Section Removal:** Removed the redundant "Get in Touch" form section to streamline the user journey.
- **Navigation Update:** Redirected the "Contact" navbar link to the footer anchor (`#footer`).
- **Imagery:** Replaced the "Sustainability" section's mountain placeholder with a highway road image to better represent the trucking industry.
